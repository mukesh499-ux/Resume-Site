# Why I Built This Site

This site serves two purposes:
1. To document my professional experience as a Database Engineer
2. To share safe, repeatable automation patterns for databases and AWS

## What You’ll Find Here
- Practical runbooks
- Automation design notes
- Lessons learned from production systems

All examples are sanitized and designed for learning purposes.
